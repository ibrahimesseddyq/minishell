-Problem in expanding 
#1 export a="      a   b   "
#2 when $ is at the end 


- change the space by the del in wildcard phase just in expand_wild card no need in expand wildcard redir

- handle CTRL D and CTRL C  in herdoc when executing builtins



- export A- doesnt work as it should

############### Notes

-Garbage collector


-Fd leaks // till now no leak but you should test

-problem in Pipes // Maybe OK should be tested more

i should handle fd leaks when signaling HEREDOC

// protect NB_DEFAULT from stack_overflow and heap_overflow

// recheck export and unset
 // test bonus

// check expand in Heredoc and after redir // to check







recheck this test i think it fails:
cat < Makefile > out >> out1 | wc -l out1 > out2
cat < Makefile > out >> out1 | wc -l out1 > out2
/bin/rm -f out
/bin/rm -f out1
/bin/rm -f out2
